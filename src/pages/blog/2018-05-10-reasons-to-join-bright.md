Bright Inventions is a great place to push your career to the next level. We offer a friendly work environment, challenging projects, meaningful development and flexibility, which is not so easy to find under one roof in other companies. But above all, we offer a team that consists of great people for whom work is something more than a place you come to every morning  and leave after 8 hours. We are a team of professionals who are not afraid of new challenges and who are also not afraid of making mistakes. Our company is built on the flat structure. Each and every person has a real impact on the choices we make regarding not only the stack we use, but also our everyday habits and the whole development. So if you would like to be surrounded by smart and likeable people who will help you develop and broaden your skills and career, Bright Inventions is a place for you.

And why you will love working with us?

1. **Because of technologies we use.** Since we are always up-to-date we do not use some stack only because it has been used for many years. We like technical challenges. We like experimenting and checking possibilities of the newest tech stack. We work with Swift and Objective-C (in older projects) for iOS platforms, and with Kotlin and Java for Android platforms. In some contexts we also apply React Native framework. If it comes about backend, we usually prefer Node.js, but we also work with Java Spring and Ruby on Rails. For building Web front-end applications our choice is React together with JavaScript or TypeScript. We also work with Ethereum and Hyperledger as a Blockchain-based app platform. And which IDE do we use? The one we feel is the best for us. Most of us choose IDE by JetBrains, but we have also experience with AppCode or Xcode if it comes about iOS development, or VS Code while programming in JavaScript/TypeScript. 

2. **Because of the atmosphere.** You will find here the work atmosphere that definitely stimulates personal growth. And I mean here not only qualified people around, but our general attitude to work. We believe that everyone is different and may need different stimuli to improve their skills. If you learn better by pair programming, you have an opportunity to do that. If you feel that you need to take part in some workshops, to speed up your career, you can. If you want to go on a conference and tell about your experience, we will support you. Everything depends on your needs. 
 
3. **Because of flexibility.** Either you are a morning bird or a night owl, you will find a good time to work with us. You can start work from 6.00 to 10.00 a.m. The time you work should comply to your efficiency curve. If you need to work at home for a day or two, we also do not see any problem with that, but remember that after all we want you to be an integral part of a team, not a remote stranger. Oh, and we are flexible also if it comes about the type of agreement you prefer. We really do not mind whether your choice is B2B, a permanent agreement or temporary one. You can choose the best one for you.

4. **Because of knowledge sharing.** We think that real professionals learn all their life and they share their knowledge with others. And how we can do it? By taking part in various conferences, by running workshops, by blogging, by CocoaHeads, by internal Coffee talks and much more.

5. **Because of good equipment and tools that we use.** We will provide you with MacBook and other devices such as screens, mice or keyboards. You just have to tell us what you need. If it comes to our toolset, on daily basis we use JIRA and Trello for project tracking, Slack, Skype and Google Hangouts for remote communication, and TeamCity, AWS CloudWatch, Upsource and GitHub for developers.
  
6. **Because of equality.** You will find at Bright  a flat structure with no management overhead. We do not have any strong hierarchy in our team. We discuss problems with each other, we look for solutions together, we propose ideas openly. There is no division for the better and the worse. We believe that regardless of your experience or knowledge everyone makes a change. At Bright no one is afraid of asking questions because we support each other and help each other.

7. **Because of GREAT PEOPLE.** And I suppose there is no need to tell more about that. Meet us and you will find out what I mean.
