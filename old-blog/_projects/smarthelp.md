title: SmartHelp
description: SmartHelp is a holistic solution for emergency services in Norway. In case of an accident the Services know where you are and how they should help you. The platform was built with 'Privacy by Design' approach in mind and has a fully end-to-end encrypted channel for exchanging messages between parties. Bright Inventions took part in the whole process from day 0, starting from ideas, through full-stack implementation to deployment and maintenance. The solution consists of two native mobile apps (iOS & Android), Emergency Services web panel and the backend.
